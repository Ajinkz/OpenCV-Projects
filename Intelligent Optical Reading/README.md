## Intelligent Optical Reading

**What is an optical reader?** <br>
The optical reader is a computer input unit that transmits information to the computer by reading the ticked boxes in predetermined locations on a printed paper. Thanks to these optical readers, a control process that can take a very long time to read can be completed in seconds.

In this project, the same logic is followed. The boxes marked by the person who takes the exam on optical paper are determined by image-processing methods.
Then correct and incorrect answers are checked and the score is calculated.
